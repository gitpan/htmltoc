MM/DD/YY
===========================================================================
02/28/96	(1.2.1)

	o  Changed "$/ = 0777;" to "undef $/;" for reading in an entire
	   file.  Perl is inconsistent across versions on using 0777
	   which causes no TOC to be generated.

===========================================================================
04/19/96	(1.2.0)

	o  Added the ability to specify ToC entries at the same level
	   to be separated by something other than <LI>.  The separator
	   string can be controlled via the -entrysep option.  The
	   default value is ", " (minus the quotes).

	o  Strip beginning and trailing whitespace from significant
	   element content when listed in the ToC.

	o  Removed filename from hrefs in inline ToCs.

	o  The expression /<body.*>/i is now used to determine location
	   of inline TOC.

	o  Escaped @ in usage statement for Perl 5.

	o  Fixed typo in cp() routine where error text used $dest instead
	   of $dst.

===========================================================================
03/31/95	(1.1.1)

	o  Fixed a statement that caused Perl 5 to grok.

===========================================================================
09/30/94	(1.1.0)

	o  SGML comment declarations are preserved in processed documents.

===========================================================================
07/25/94	(1.0.0)

	o  Added a -useorg option.  This tells htmltoc to use
	   previously generated ".org" files as the html source
	   to process if they exist.  Good if error occured during
	   a previous run.

	o  Properly detects NAME attributes in anchors with whitespace
	   around the '=' character.

	o  Recognizes single quotes as delimiters for the value of
	   a NAME attribute.

	o  Some informative output to STDERR occurs during processing.
	   This can be supressed with the -quiet option.

	o  Warning generated if a significant element contains no
	   textual content.

	o  IMG tag explicity ignored if contained in significant element.

===========================================================================
07/21/94	(1.0.0 beta)

	o Initial release
