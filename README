INSTALLATION

The documentation contains a section on installing htmltoc for Unix
machines.

    Interactive Install:

        Run the following command:

            perl install.me

        The installation program will ask you a series of questions on
        where the Perl executable is and where to put htmltoc files.
        Just hit <CR> to accept the default values listed in ()'s.

    Batch Install:

        1. Edit the file 'install.cfg'.
        2. Run the following command:

            perl install.me install.cfg

        The installation program will output information on what
        is being installed and where it is being installed.

	NOTE
	    htmltoc has no library files to install.  Hence $dolib
	    should equal zero.

Notes on Installation Program

    o The '#!' line in the installed htmltoc program is set to
      point to the Perl executable specified in the installation
      process.

    o If you specify paths that do not exist, the install.me
      program will create the path ONLY if running in interactive
      more.  If using a configuration file (eg: install.cfg) you
      must check that all paths specified exist.
